# Instructions for Image Files

This is the repository for facsimile image files of primary source materials.

## Format

Files should be in either `.jpg` or `.png` file format. Photograph each page separately, and aim for the maximum resolution without extending the size-limit of 2MB per file.

## Directories and Files

The directory with the initial letter of your surname contains a folder of the format `YYYY`. You should group your images by year of recording. If the folder is out of date simple create a new one for, e.g. `2020` and sent a PR to the template repo.

### Subfolders

You should create a unique ID for each document, in cases of archival research you can simply reuse call-numbers or similar id numbers. For documents from private collections without ID, you should design (and follow) and ID scheme and document it in the `readme.md` of the images folder here. So the full path so far would be: `materials/image/H/2019/NCC1701/`

### File Name

Filenames should be unique across the project, and help you identify what a file contains when just looking at its name. Each File name consists of three elements separated by underscores `_`:
-   the date of collecting in full format `YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g. `2019-05-01`
-   the type of document (e.g. `diary`, `notebook`, etc) in no cap letters, whenever you add a new type, please also add it to the readme below.
-   the abbreviation of your workpackage, `WP1`, followed by `-` and a the four digit sequential numerical ID of each page, e.g. `WP1-0001`


the full file name would look like this (see the example file): `2019-05-01_diary_WP1-0001.jpg`

## Readme

Each folder should contain a `readme.md` with basic bibliographical information about the document, title, author, genre, provenance, date and location of collection etc. in written language. Imaging coming back to the folder in a few years time trying to see whats in it. Use full sentences on the readme, not just keywords and abbreviations (i.e. `Shanghai`, not `~~SH~~`). Tools for adding keywords to your files are covered elsewhere, the readme has to be able to stand on its own.

A basic readme has already been included here, feel free to copy and paste it as many times as you need.
